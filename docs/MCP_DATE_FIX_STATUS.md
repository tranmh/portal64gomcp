# MCP Rating History Date Fix - Status Report

## Problem
Rating history entries are showing missing dates as `"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"` instead of actual tournament dates.

## Changes Made to MCP Client

### 1. Updated Type Definitions
**File: `pkg/portal64/types.go`**
- Added missing date fields to `TournamentResponse`: `FinishedOn`, `ComputedOn`, `RecomputedOn`

**File: `internal/api/models.go`** 
- Added missing date fields to internal `TournamentResponse`: `ComputedOn`, `RecomputedOn`

### 2. Enhanced Tournament Details Fetching
**File: `internal/api/client.go`**
- Updated `GetTournamentDetails()` to handle multiple response formats:
  - Enhanced tournament response (with nested structure)
  - Simple tournament response 
  - Wrapped API response

### 3. Modified Rating History Date Logic
**File: `internal/api/client.go` - `GetPlayerRatingHistory()` method**
- **Primary approach**: Uses tournament search API to find tournament dates
- **Date priority order**: `finished_on` > `computed_on` > `recomputed_on` > `end_date`
- **Fallback**: Attempts to use `GetTournamentDetails()` if search fails

## Current Issue

Despite all changes, dates are still showing as `"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"`. This suggests:

1. **Tournament search isn't finding matches** - Even though we know tournaments exist (e.g., `B735-705-QCB`)
2. **Data structure mismatch** - The response format might not match our expectations
3. **API connectivity issue** - Tournament endpoints might not be accessible

## Debugging Steps Completed

✅ Verified API server is running (`portal64-mcp:check_api_health` works)  
✅ Confirmed tournaments exist (`portal64-mcp:search_tournaments` finds `B735-705-QCB`)  
✅ Verified tournament details endpoint returns null (`portal64-mcp:get_tournament_details` returns empty)  
✅ Updated MCP client to use search API as primary method  
✅ Fixed data structure parsing (SearchTournaments returns `[]TournamentResponse`)  

## Next Steps Needed

To fix this issue, we need to debug why the search approach isn't working:

1. **Add debug logging** to see what the search API actually returns
2. **Verify the tournament search matching logic** - exact match vs partial match
3. **Check if tournaments have the date fields populated** in the search results
4. **Test with a working tournament** that definitely has date data

## Current Status: ❌ NOT WORKING
The MCP client is built and running but still returns missing dates.

**Your API endpoint `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tournaments/{tournament_id}` should work** - the issue appears to be in how the MCP client processes the tournament data, not with your API itself.
