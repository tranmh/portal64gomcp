# Test Strategy for Portal64 MCP Server

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Portal64 MCP Server, a Golang-based Model Context Protocol server that provides structured access to the German chess DWZ rating system via the Portal64 REST API.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid principle with a focus on:
- **Fast feedback loops** through unit tests
- **Integration reliability** through service integration tests
- **End-to-end confidence** through MCP protocol tests
- **Production readiness** through system tests

## Test Levels

### 1. Unit Tests (Foundation Layer)

#### Scope
- Individual functions and methods
- Business logic validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

#### Coverage Areas

##### Configuration Management (`internal/config`)
- Configuration loading from files and environment variables
- Configuration validation
- Default value handling
- Invalid configuration scenarios

##### API Client (`internal/api`)
- HTTP client functionality
- Request/response serialization
- Error handling and retries
- Timeout behavior
- Model validation

##### MCP Protocol Implementation (`internal/mcp`)
- Protocol message parsing
- Tool registration and execution
- Resource handling
- Server lifecycle management
- Error response formatting

##### Package Functions (`pkg/portal64`)
- Core business logic
- Data transformations
- Utility functions

#### Testing Framework
- **Primary**: Go's built-in `testing` package
- **Assertions**: `testify/assert` for readable assertions
- **Mocking**: `testify/mock` for interface mocking
- **Coverage Target**: 85% minimum line coverage

### 2. Integration Tests (Service Layer)

#### Scope
- Component interactions
- External API integration
- Database interactions (if applicable)
- Configuration integration

#### Coverage Areas

##### API Client Integration
- Real Portal64 API communication (with test environment)
- HTTP client configuration
- Response parsing and error handling
- Connection pooling and timeouts

##### MCP Server Integration
- Tool execution with real API calls
- Resource access patterns
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory and resource management

#### Test Environment
- **Mock Portal64 API**: HTTP test server with predefined responses
- **Test Fixtures**: Sample data representing various API responses
- **Isolation**: Each test runs with fresh server instance

### 3. End-to-End Tests (System Layer)

#### Scope
- Complete MCP protocol communication
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Performance characteristics
- Error recovery

#### Coverage Areas

##### MCP Protocol Compliance
- Tool discovery and listing
- Tool execution with various parameters
- Resource enumeration and access
- Error propagation and formatting

##### Functional Scenarios
- Player search workflows
- Club information retrieval
- Tournament data access
- Administrative operations

#### Test Setup
- **MCP Client Simulator**: Mock MCP client for protocol testing
- **Test Data**: Comprehensive fixture data covering all tool scenarios
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and throughput measurements

### 4. System Tests (Production-Like Environment)

#### Scope
- Full system deployment
- Real external dependencies
- Performance under load
- Security validation

#### Coverage Areas

##### Deployment Testing
- Binary execution in target environment
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring
- Graceful shutdown

##### Performance Testing
- Load testing with concurrent MCP clients
- Memory usage patterns
- API rate limiting behavior
- Error rate under stress

## Test Categories

### Functional Tests

#### Happy Path Testing
- Valid tool executions with expected parameters
- Successful resource access
- Proper data transformation and presentation

#### Error Handling Testing
- Invalid tool parameters
- API unavailability scenarios
- Network timeouts and retries
- Malformed API responses

#### Edge Case Testing
- Boundary value testing (pagination limits, date ranges)
- Empty result sets
- Large result sets
- Concurrent request handling

### Non-Functional Tests

#### Performance Testing
- **Response Time**: Tools should respond within 5 seconds under normal load
- **Throughput**: System should handle 100 concurrent MCP requests
- **Resource Usage**: Memory usage should remain stable under load

#### Security Testing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message information disclosure
- Configuration security (no secrets in logs)

#### Reliability Testing
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation when Portal64 API is unavailable
- System stability under continuous operation

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- **Player Data**: Sample players with various rating histories
- **Club Data**: Test clubs with different member counts and statistics
- **Tournament Data**: Tournaments across different date ranges and statuses
- **Error Scenarios**: API error responses for testing error handling

### Data Isolation
- Each test suite uses isolated test data
- Tests do not depend on external data state
- Mock data simulates real API response structures

## Continuous Integration Strategy

- Run unit tests and linting
- Ensure code formatting standards
- Validate test coverage thresholds

### CI Pipeline Stages
